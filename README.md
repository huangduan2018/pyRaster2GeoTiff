# pyRaster2GeoTiff

A piece of Python code to convert rater data such as NetCDF to GeoTIFF format.
The code was extracted from my LinkedIn article at https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/convert-netcdf4-file-geotiff-using-python-chonghua-yin/.

In addition, it is better to try the code under a virtual environment as many Python packages are imcompatible.
